# Psychic-Game

Welcome to my Psychic Game!

The purpose of this game is to help me learn javascript! The game was fun to create although 
mostly incredibly challenging. Of course in hindsight it all makes sense. Funny how that works!

The instructions of the game are simple and straight forward; you will try to guess what letter
the computer is thinking of by pressing keys on the keyboard. You will start each round with 9 guess. 
If you don't guess the correct letter within those 9 guesses, the computer wins. If you guess correctly within your 9 guesses you win!

I'd like to thank my contributors to this project:
Thank you Sarah Cullen for being such an amazing instructor and equipping me with the knowledge required to
complete this project.
A big thank you also to Sangeetha for debugging my code and helping me fill in the many, many, MANY
gaps and spotting even more missing semicolons and all of my misspellings! I'd be lost without you 
Sangeetha!

Stay tuned for my next masterpiece, Crystal Collector, crashing on to the scene sonner than I'd like to think about!
